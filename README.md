# Face Detection

This project focuses on utilizing the OpenCV library for face detection in a video stream, with FastAPI employed for both server and client aspects. Additionally, the frontend in this test employs Streamlit, a framework for creating user interfaces based on the Python language.


## Installation

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the FastAPI server
```
python api.py
```

## Run the client script
```
streamlit run client.py
```

## Usage
Start the FastAPI server on the server machine.
Run the client script on the client machine.
View the video stream and detected faces via the Streamlit interface.
